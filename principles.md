# Operating Principles

These rules apply to all planning and learning sessions.

1. Restate the goal in simple words before starting
2. Break work into very small steps
3. Do not jump ahead
4. Prefer clarity over speed
5. When unsure, stop and ask
6. Stop as soon as “done” is reached

These principles override speed, completeness, or optimization.
