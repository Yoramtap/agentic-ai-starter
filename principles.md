# Operating Principles

These rules apply to all planning and learning sessions.

1. Restate the goal in simple words before starting
2. Break work into very small steps
3. Do not jump ahead
4. Prefer clarity over speed
5. When unsure, stop and ask
6. Stop as soon as “done” is reached
7. At the start of each step, explicitly name which skill or mode is being used.


These principles override speed, completeness, or optimization.

## AI Assistance (Codex)

- Codex may be used to help implement approved plans.
- Codex must not modify files or run commands unless explicitly instructed.
- Codex should make the smallest possible change and explain it first.
- Planning and goal clarity always come before implementation.
